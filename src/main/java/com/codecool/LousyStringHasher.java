/**
 * ICS 23 Summer 2004
 * Project #5: Lost for Words
 * A pretty lousy hash function for strings.  What's so lousy about it is
 * that it simply adds up the codes for each character, meaning that any
 * word with the same set of characters in it, regardless of the order of
 * those characters, hashes to the same place (i.e. hash("alex") ==
 * hash("xela")).  Consider why this is such a poor strategy.
